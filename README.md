# Bootcamp-Project-1
First Project
Simplifying an existing application to become easier to read and work with on the coding side while not changing how the page itself runs and operates.

Many div tags were changed to more descriptive options, and classes were collapsed so there were no redundant ones (I.E. ones that had the same coding could all be the same class).
